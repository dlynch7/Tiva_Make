# Tiva_Make
Makefile for Texas Instruments' Tiva-C microcontroller

## Description
Uses a Makefile to build an app for the Tiva-C that blinks an onboard LED and sets up a console interface using a UART.
Pretty simple, but the Makefile also supports fancier stuff, especially floating-point math on the Tiva, which can be a pain to figure out from scratch.
